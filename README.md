# VBA
A collection of useful quick VBA scripts
These scripts were written quickly to solve a particular issue, and as such are not tested for all uses. They are mostly intended to be examples for myself or others on how I accomplished something in the past.
The scripts are split between Office products, although some will run in multiple programs.
